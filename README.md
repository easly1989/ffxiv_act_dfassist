# As of 05 February 2020 
### The plugin is in full maintenance mode
### This means that, until further notice, the plugin will not be updated
> Unfortunately I'm not actively playing FFXIV anymore, and lost interests also in the plugin development scenario.
> 
> I'm not deleting the repository, or archiving it, as you may not know when the will to come back to the game (and this plugin development) will return.
> 
> I hope that, by luck or good coding, you will still be able to use the plugin in the near future.
> I wish every old (and new) user a very nice and safe journey in Eorzea, may the light of the crystal shine your paths!

> Farewell! :)

## About this Plugin
A simple plugin to scout the next dungoeon/trial/raid (instance to be generic) you are going to enter.<br>
*It works only on windows 10 and, for the moment, only with final fantasy in Borderless Windowed Mode.*<br>
If you find any bug or have any idea to share and optimize the plugin fill free to contact me or open an Issue (:

## Telegram and Pushbullet Support!
As of version 2.0.0, you can now set up Telegram and Pushbullet notifications directly from within DFAssist plugin settings!

## TTS Support!
As of version 1.4.1, Text to Speech has been added, and can be enabled from the plugin page inside ACT!

## Automatic ACT Updates!
Starting from version 1.3.11 DFAssist supports AutoUpdating directly from within ACT

### Why another rework?!?
It seems like **lalafellsleep** simply stopped the development, and using an external tool (like the one from **devunt**) seems a bit like an overkill...<br>
... We already use ACT for various things, so integrate this feature seems like a better option (:
 
### To-dos
- [x] Automatic Updates from within ACT
- [x] Remove unused support for Telegram
- [x] Remove unused support for FATEs
- [x] Handle Assembly resolve without locking dlls
- [x] Handle test mode, enable users to see instances code
- [x] add TTS support
- [x] add Telegram support
- [x] add PushBullet support
- [x] add Discord support
- [ ] Inject toasts in game (to make it work even in full screen mode)
